### Introduction
This package provides an informative popup that shows the docstring of the
candidates in [company][https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode] menu.

[company-posframe][https://github.com/tumashu/company-posframe],
[company-quickhelp][https://github.com/company-mode/company-quickhelp],
```company-tip``` works in terminal Emacs, as it depends on Emacs' overlay
feature.
